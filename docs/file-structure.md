File Structure
--------------

- `bower.json` : Dependencies of the project, if you need to add or remove libraries from your application, edit this file
- `Gruntfile.js` : Your friendly [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) configuration file, `npm start` will run the default task specified in this file
- `js` : All of your application code lives in here
- `lumbar.json` : A config containing all of the routes and files that compose your application
- `package.json` : Standard npm config file, only needed while still developing your app
- `public` : Will be served as the root directory by the server
- `public/modules` : Your generated application code, this folder should generally not be checked into git
- `stylesheets` : Generally speaking your styles should be application wide (in `base.css`) or split up per module
- `tasks` : Any extra grunt tasks, including the scaffolding
- `templates` : Handlebars templates, if a view was generated by scaffolding then
the view's name will be same as template name; Also, if a template shares the same name / path as a view it will be auto assigned as the `template` property of the view
