From Zero to Hero
------------------

    git clone git://github.com/AndrewJHart/vesel

Once your clone is complete, change directories into your cloned seed and run:

    npm install

This may take a minute. Note that all of the dependencies are specific to making it easier to build, run and test your app. Once your app is written it can be deployed in any environment. Once `npm install` is finished you can start your app:

  > Note: There is an issue with the npm registry live-reload package so if you run into issues try installing thorax-inspector separately `npm install thorax-inspector` and then run `npm start` or `grunt` -- This does **not** effect scaffolding :)

    npm start

A new window will open in your default browser with some stuff.
