        <h1>HPD <i>Community Force</i> Initiative</h1>
        <p>The Huntington Police Department is dedicated to it's Mission Statement:</p>

        <p><i>The mission of the Huntington Police Department is to provide the highest level of professional police service while preventing crime through problem-solving partnerships.</i></p>

        <p>This mission is accomplished by a commitment to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Reduce criminal victimization</li>
          <li>Call offenders to account</li>
          <li>Reduce fear and enhance personal security</li>
          <li>Strive to ensure safety in public places</li>
          <li>When required, use force fairly, efficiently, and effectively</li>
          <li>Maintain fiscal responsibility to our citizens</li>
          <li>Meet the expectations of our community</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Occasionally, members of the HPD develop a concept for a program which does not contain an element of Law Enforcement, but is a powerful tool for the overall betterment of our community. These projects fall under our <strong>Community Force</strong> Initiative.</p>

        <p>The CF Initiative is the department's method of fostering positive ideologies into the community at large, and provides the citizenry with resources to enable an atmosphere of progress, growth, and most importantly, hope. Any project under the CF title has little to no element of law enforcment, but rather has been created within the department to demonstrate our commitment to excellence in multiple arenas.</p>

        <p>Projects that fall in to the CF Initiative category will always contain the Community Force slogan in order to convey to the beneficiaries of or participants in the projects that the department was heavily involved in the project's creation, design, implimentation, curriculum, organization, and funding. Additionally, the CF projects reflect our ongoing partnership with multiple entities, such as City Government, as we work to achieve a common goal.</p>

        <p>As we reflect on our mission statement, it is the last line: <i>Meet the expectations of our community</i> which has inspired our obligation to provide innovative and forward thinking concepts which exceed the conventional philosophies of police departments, and encourage all citizens to be involved in our <i>Community Force</i></p>
