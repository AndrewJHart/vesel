[Vesel](https://github.com/AndrewJHart/vesel) is work in progress framework for building Single
Page Applications that are designed for mobile devices with transitions and animations baked into
the core (see AnimView).

Vesel is currently a part of a project and a work-in-progress framework. Internally this is the base javascript project for the Heads Up webapp, but once its complete plans are to open source this to make everyones lives easier. Vesel is currently a combination of [Thorax](http://thoraxjs.org/) + [Lumbar](http://walmartlabs.github.com/lumbar).
